# Line-follower
For my class and a matches

I putted all the setup in the classes setverAV is to make the robot go straight and the others is to see if the robot is getting away from the line.
I DevieD is to see if the captor on the left detect the dark and if it's verified the robot will turn on right to go straight on the line.
same things for the left in devieG.
